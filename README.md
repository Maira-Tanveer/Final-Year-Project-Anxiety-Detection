# Anxiety Detection Web App (Urdu Language)

## Overview

This is a *machine learning-powered web application* designed to detect anxiety from *Urdu text*. Users can input natural Urdu sentences describing their feelings or situations, and the app predicts:

1. Whether the user is experiencing *anxiety or not* (Binary classification)  
2. If yes, the *type of anxiety* (Multiclass: e.g., Panic Disorder, Phobia, Selective Mutism, Social Anxiety, etc.)  
3. The *severity level* of anxiety (Multiclass: Mild, Moderate, Severe, Panic)

The aim is to promote early detection and mental health awareness in *South Asian communities*, offering support in a private and culturally relevant way.

## Problem Statement

In Urdu-speaking societies, mental health is often stigmatized or ignored due to cultural beliefs and lack of accessible resources. Common barriers include:

- "We are not mad, why go to a psychologist?"  
- Shame and silence around emotional well-being  
- Lack of Urdu-language tools for early detection  

### Project Goals:

- Allow users to express feelings in *Urdu* and get quick, anonymous anxiety assessments  
- Use NLP + ML to detect anxiety type and severity  
- Create a friendly and *non-judgmental* interface  

---

## Dataset

Since no public dataset was available, we created a *custom dataset* of approx. *12,000 Urdu entries*, labeled with:

- binary: 0 (No Anxiety), 1 (Anxiety)  
- all_labels: Type of anxiety (e.g., Panic, Phobia, Selective Mutism)  
- levels: Severity level (Mild, Moderate, Severe, Panic)  

### Annotation Process:

- Labeled manually using real-life examples  
- Reviewed by psychology students and mental health professionals
